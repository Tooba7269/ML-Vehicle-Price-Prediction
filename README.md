# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

### 👤 By Tooba Zahid | GitHub: [Tooba7269](https://github.com/Tooba7269)

This project is part of my machine learning portfolio for demonstrating technical depth and applied data science skills, especially in support of the UK Global Talent Visa application (Tech Nation route). It features an end-to-end ML pipeline to predict used car prices using structured automotive listings data.
