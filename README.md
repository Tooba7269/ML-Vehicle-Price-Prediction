# üöó Used Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

### üë§ Author: Tooba Zahid

A complete machine learning pipeline to predict used car prices based on structured advert data. Includes feature engineering, model tuning, cross-validation, and evaluation.

## üì¶ Dataset

Due to file size limits, the dataset is shared externally:

- üîó [Google Sheets (Download as CSV)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JOq6Is1VLsvQ_LwsqtPUqT3G-j_05k9XzwJSOO1wU4o/edit?usp=sharing)
- üóúÔ∏è `adverts.csv.zip` ‚Äî included in this repo

Once downloaded, extract and place `adverts.csv` in a folder named `data/`, or upload it directly to Colab:

```python
# For Google Colab
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
Google Colab (Python 3.x)

pandas, numpy

matplotlib, seaborn

scikit-learn (models, GridSearchCV, metrics)

category_encoders (Target Encoding)

üî¨ Workflow Summary
1. üßº Data Preprocessing
Filled missing values using domain logic (e.g., 2021 for "NEW" cars)

Removed outliers/errors in year_of_registration, mileage, and price

2. üèó Feature Engineering
One-Hot Encoding for: condition, fuel_type

Target Encoding for: make, model, body_type, colour

MinMax Scaling applied to numeric features

3. üß† Modeling
Trained 3 regression models:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor (tuned via GridSearchCV)

k-Nearest Neighbors Regressor

Applied Cross-validation to measure generalization

Performance tested on held-out test set

üìä Model Performance
Model	R¬≤ Score (Test)	Mean Training R¬≤	Score Difference
Linear Regression	0.7891	0.7919	0.0028
Decision Tree	0.9325	0.9333	0.0008
KNN Regressor	0.8880	0.9111	0.0231

‚úÖ Best Model: Decision Tree Regressor
üìâ KNN showed some overfitting (training > test)

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run in Google Colab
Go to Google Colab

Upload mlp_code.py or paste it into a Colab notebook

üîÑ Workflow Summary
1. Data Preprocessing

Handled year_of_registration, price, and mileage issues

2. Feature Engineering
One-hot encoding: condition, fuel_type

Target encoding: make, model, body_type, colour

MinMaxScaler applied to numeric fields

3. Model Training
Linear Regression
